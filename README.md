## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on mpg values. 

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope of the linear model is not consired to be zero. The p is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes, this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. According to the summary output, the r-squared value of 0.7 is strong, while the p-value 5.35e-11 is significant.
